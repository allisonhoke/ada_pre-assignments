What is your learning style?

My dominant learning style is Kinesthetic. I prefer to learn by watching someone demonstrate and then trying it out myself. I can use the other learning styles to being to understand something, but feel like I am really learning when I get to experiment with something. Second to kinesthetic, I am a Visual learner. Maps, charts, and diagrams best help me to understand a concept prior to me trying it out kinesthetically.
